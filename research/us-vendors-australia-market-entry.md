## 5. Success Factors

### What Makes US Vendors Succeed in Australia

1. **Established Local Partner Network**
   - Nuance's success built on 20+ year partner relationships
   - Partners provide credibility, support, and sales channels
   - Example: Voice Recognition Australia, VoiceX

2. **Australian Data Sovereignty**
   - Data hosted in Australian data centres
   - Compliance with Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)
   - Builds trust with healthcare organizations

3. **Local EHR Integration**
   - Integration with Australian-specific EMRs (Best Practice, Medical Director, Genie)
   - Not just Epic/Cerner which dominate US market
   - Requires local development investment

4. **Regulatory Proactivity**
   - Early engagement with TGA requirements
   - Willingness to register as medical device if required
   - Transparency about AI capabilities and limitations

5. **Appropriate Pricing**
   - Australian market is price-sensitive
   - Enterprise US pricing doesn't translate well
   - Free tiers or competitive pricing important for adoption

### Common Failure Modes

1. **Assuming US Model Translates Directly**
   - Different EHR landscape
   - Different privacy regulations
   - Different clinical workflows
   - Different healthcare funding model (Medicare, PBS)

2. **Underestimating Regulatory Burden**
   - TGA scrutiny increasing for AI medical devices
   - Digital scribes may require ARTG registration
   - Non-compliance = illegal supply in Australia

3. **Lack of Local Support**
   - Remote US-based support inadequate
   - Time zone challenges
   - Clinicians expect local responsiveness

4. **Enterprise-Only Approach**
   - Australian healthcare fragmented (many small practices)
   - Not just large hospital systems like US
   - Need solutions for solo practitioners and small clinics

5. **Ignoring Local Competition**
   - Heidi Health has strong local brand
   - Community-driven adoption
   - Price advantage significant

### Local Partnership Importance

**Critical Success Factor:**

> "We find it's not the technologies that fail but the founders who fail because they aren't ready or prepared to have those conversations."

**Partnership Benefits:**
- Regulatory navigation expertise
- Sales channel access
- Local credibility and trust
- Support infrastructure
- Market intelligence

**Successful Partnership Examples:**
- Nuance → Voice Recognition Australia (21 years)
- Nuance → VoiceX Communications (multiple cities)
- Microsoft → ORdigiNAL (Dragon Copilot launch partner)

### Regulatory Hurdles

#### TGA AI Medical Scribe Review (2024-2025)

**Key Findings from TGA:**

1. Some digital scribes may already meet medical device definition
2. Digital scribes that suggest diagnoses/treatments are likely medical devices
3. Non-compliant products being supplied illegally
4. Urgent review of digital scribes recommended
5. Developer unwillingness to engage with regulation noted

**Compliance Requirements:**
- ARTG registration if classified as medical device
- Evidence of quality, safety, and performance
- Post-market surveillance
- Manufacturer obligations under Therapeutic Goods Act 1989

**Future Direction:**
- $39.9M federal funding over 5 years for Safe and Responsible AI
- Targeted consultations through 2025-2026
- Digital scribes and mental health tools flagged for regulatory reform

#### Pathway for US Vendors

| Pathway | Requirements | Challenge |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| FDA 510(k) → TGA | MDSAP Certificate covering Australian requirements | Most US vendors don't have MDSAP |
| EU CE Mark → TGA | EU certification accepted | Broad alignment with EU rules |
| Direct TGA submission | Full Australian regulatory submission | Time and cost intensive |
