# Australian Healthcare AI Market Landscape 2025

## Executive Summary

Australia's healthcare AI market is experiencing significant growth, projected to reach **US$2.16 billion by 2030** with a **40.7% CAGR** from 2024-2030. While representing only 0.9% of the global healthcare AI market, Australia has emerged as a key innovation hub with homegrown success stories like Harrison.ai, Heidi Health, and Lyrebird Health. However, despite high awareness (93% AI adoption rate reported), actual clinical implementation remains limited due to regulatory uncertainty, clinician trust issues, and infrastructure challenges.

## 4. Adoption Trends

### 4.1 Current AI Adoption Rates

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| AI awareness in healthcare | 93% | NSW, QLD, SA leading |
| Clinical AI deployments (public hospitals) | ~2 known stories | Extremely limited |
| Trust in AI vs fear | 30% trust > fear | 70% more fearful than trusting |
| Clinician readiness cited as barrier | 66% | HIC 2024 survey |

**Reality check:** Despite high "adoption" figures, actual clinical AI implementation in Australian hospitals is described as "almost non-existent."

### 4.2 Barriers to Adoption

| Barrier | Impact | Details |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Regulatory uncertainty** | High | No national AI standards; TGA consultation ongoing; $39.9M budget for AI guardrails |
| **Clinician trust** | High | "Black box" concerns; difficulty distinguishing accurate from inaccurate predictions |
| **Data privacy** | High | Patient consent questions; data sovereignty concerns |
| **IT infrastructure** | Medium | Legacy systems; inconsistent EMR adoption |
| **Financial constraints** | Medium | ROI unclear; competing budget priorities |
| **Policy vacuum** | High | Patchwork of rules; some networks ban AI entirely; others permit without accountability |

### 4.3 Drivers of Adoption

| Driver | Impact | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Clinician burnout** | High | 65% of physicians report burnout linked to admin overload |
| **Workforce shortages** | High | GP shortage crisis; rural access gaps |
| **COVID digital acceleration** | High | Telehealth usage explosion; 118.2M remote appointments (2020-2022) |
| **Government investment** | Medium | $39.9M AI safety budget; MRFF funding; NRFC investments |
| **International competition** | Medium | Risk of falling behind; pressure to adopt proven solutions |
| **Cost pressures** | Medium | Bulk billing rate decline; need for efficiency |

### 4.4 COVID-19 Impact on Digital Health

| Metric | Pre-COVID | Post-COVID | Change |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------|
| My Health Record adoption | 20% | 90% | +350% |
| Telehealth services (Mar 2020 - Jul 2022) | Minimal | 118.2M appointments | Massive |
| Government telehealth investment (2020) | - | AUD $669M | New |
| Video consultation preference | - | Majority still telephone | Unexpected |

**Key learnings:**
- "A decade's worth of work in a matter of days" - rapid digital transformation
- "Forced adoption" led to cultural legitimisation of telehealth
- Video preferred by policymakers but telephone dominated actual use
- Permanent MBS telehealth items established
