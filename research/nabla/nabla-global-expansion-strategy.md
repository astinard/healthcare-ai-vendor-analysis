| **Tier 2** (French, Spanish) | Very High | Strong European/Hispanic support |
| **Tier 3** (Other 31 languages) | Good | Launched September 2024 |

### Multilingual Workflow

**How It Works:**

5. Transcript available in original language

- Focus is on documentation rather than simultaneous interpretation
- Transcription in multiple languages with English note generation
- Patient instructions and summaries in patient's preferred language

**Potential Enhancement:**
- Real-time interpretation would be natural product extension
- Multilingual speech-to-text foundation already in place

| **Security** | AES-256 encryption, SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001 |
| **Data Subject Rights** | De-identification for any stored data |
| **Cross-Border Transfers** | Compliant with EU-US data frameworks |
