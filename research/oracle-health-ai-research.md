# Oracle Health (Cerner) AI Research Report

**Research Date:** November 21, 2025
**Vendor:** Oracle Health (formerly Cerner Corporation)
**Acquisition:** Oracle acquired Cerner for $28 billion in June 2022

---

## Executive Summary

Oracle Health is undergoing a major transformation, rebuilding the legacy Cerner EHR platform from the ground up as an "AI-first" system built on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. The company launched its next-generation ambulatory EHR in August 2025, with acute care functionality planned for 2026. While Oracle Health continues to lose market share to Epic (22.9% vs 42.3% in acute care), early adopters of Oracle's Clinical AI Agent report strong satisfaction with a 30% reduction in documentation time.

## 5. Post-Acquisition AI Strategy

### Larry Ellison's Vision

> "Our biggest differentiator is the quality of our AI agents. When a doctor consults with a patient, we listen to that consultation, and we record all the prescriptions, all the doctor's orders, all the doctor's notes... The interface to our system is voice, primarily voice. The whole system is made up of AI agents."

### Strategic Priorities

1. **Complete Platform Rebuild**
   - Using APEX AI Code Generator to rebuild Cerner platform
   - Original build: 25 years
   - AI-assisted rebuild target: 3 years
   - 10x developer productivity improvement claimed

2. **Voice-First Interface**
   - Primary interface is voice, not keyboard/mouse
   - AI agents handle transcription, documentation, suggestions

3. **Healthcare Ecosystem Integration**
   - Goal: Automate and interconnect entire healthcare ecosystem
   - Components: Patients, providers, payers, pharma, banks, government

4. **National Health Database**
   - Building unified national database of medical records
   - Improved information access for healthcare professionals

5. **Security Innovation**
   - Eliminating passwords entirely
   - Biometric authentication only

### AI Technology Approach

- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Access to latest medical literature, test results, clinical trials
- **Agentic AI**: Autonomous agents that surface insights and suggest actions
- **Semantic Database**: Built specifically for AI, enabling "live, evergreen data"
