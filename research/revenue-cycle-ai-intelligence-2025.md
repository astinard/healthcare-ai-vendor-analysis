3. Automatically fills out and submits authorization forms
4. Tracks request status in real-time
5. Clinicians review AI-generated recommendations before submission

**Key Innovation:** Transforms weeks-long process into **minutes**

**Scalability:** Designed for expansion to:
- Other payers at Allegheny Health Network
- Other provider networks beyond Highmark ecosystem
- Commercial availability to other health insurers

**Supporting Programs:**

## Key Themes & Takeaways

### 1. From Back-End Fix to Front-End Prevention
The industry is shifting investment upstream. Preventing denials at documentation time is more valuable than fighting them post-submission.

### 2. Ambient AI as Revenue Cycle Entry Point
Clinical documentation is becoming the foundation for billing accuracy, with companies like Abridge embedding revenue intelligence directly into patient conversations.

### 3. Agentic AI Emergence
Both R1 RCM and Cedar are deploying autonomous AI agents capable of independent decision-making—from coding to patient billing inquiries.

### 4. Payer-Provider Convergence
The Abridge-Highmark partnership demonstrates a new model where payers and providers collaborate on AI-powered prior authorization, potentially transforming adversarial relationships.

### 5. Integration Imperative
Standalone solutions are giving way to end-to-end platforms. Waystar's Iodine acquisition and R1's Phare acquisition signal consolidation toward unified clinical-financial intelligence.

### 6. Regulatory Watch
State-level restrictions on AI in claims decisions are emerging, requiring vendors to maintain human oversight capabilities.

## Vendor Selection Considerations

| Factor | Key Questions |
|--------|---------------|
| **Integration** | Does it connect to your EHR? Can it share data across clinical and financial systems? |
| **Specialty Coverage** | Does it support your specific specialties and workflow needs? |
| **Payer Intelligence** | Does it incorporate payer-specific rules and historical patterns? |
| **Compliance** | HIPAA-compliant? Maintains audit trails? Human oversight capabilities? |
| **ROI Timeline** | What's the expected payback period? Are there comparable case studies? |
| **Scalability** | Can it grow with your organization? Multi-site deployment experience? |
