### ROI Model for Ramsay

#### Conservative Estimate

**Assumptions:**
- 40,000 documentation-active clinicians
- 2 hours/day saved per clinician
- 50% adoption rate
- $50/hour effective labor cost

**Calculation:**
```
Daily Savings = 40,000 × 50% × 2 hours × $50 = $2,000,000/day
Annual Savings = $2,000,000 × 250 working days = $500,000,000
```

#### Additional Value Drivers
- Reduced clinician turnover (burnout mitigation)
- Improved documentation quality
- Better compliance with standards
- Enhanced patient experience
- Increased clinical capacity

### Adoption Barriers

#### Technical Barriers
| Barrier | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
