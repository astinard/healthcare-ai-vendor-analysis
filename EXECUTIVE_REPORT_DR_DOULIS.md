# Healthcare AI Vendor Analysis for Ramsay Health Care
## Executive Report for Dr. John Doulis

**Prepared by:** Alex Stinard, MD
**Date:** November 2025
**Classification:** Strategic Intelligence

---

## Executive Summary

This report synthesizes 78,000 words of competitive intelligence on the healthcare AI ambient documentation market, with specific focus on vendor fit for Ramsay Health Care's global operations across Australia, UK, France, Nordics, and Asia.

### Key Finding

**Nabla is the optimal single-vendor solution for Ramsay's global footprint.** No other vendor combines the multi-language support (35+), EHR-agnostic architecture, GDPR-native compliance, and enterprise scale that Ramsay requires. For Australia specifically, Heidi Health offers strong local market leadership as a complementary or alternative option.

### The Market Reality (November 2025)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global ambient AI market | $3.5B → $15B+ by 2030 |
| US adoption | ~15% of physicians (accelerating) |
| Market leader | Nuance/Microsoft (33% share) |
| Fastest growing | Abridge (30% share, $5.3B valuation) |
| Best fit for Ramsay | **Nabla** (global) / **Heidi** (Australia) |

---

## Part 1: Market Landscape

### The Big Three

| Vendor | Valuation | Key Strength | Ramsay Fit |
|--------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **Nuance/Microsoft** | $19.7B acquisition | Enterprise incumbent, Epic integration | Medium - US-centric |
| **Abridge** | $5.3B | Best in KLAS, Epic "First Pal" | Low - US/Epic focused |
| **Nabla** | ~$500M | Multi-language, EHR-agnostic, GDPR-native | **HIGH** |

### Emerging Players

| Vendor | Focus | Differentiation | Ramsay Fit |
|--------|-------|-----------------|------------|
| **Heidi Health** | Australia/APAC | Local market leader, AU EHRs | **HIGH (Australia)** |
| **Ambience** | Enterprise | $1B+ unicorn, coding focus | Medium |
| **Suki** | Platform | MEDITECH leader, voice-first | Low |
| **DeepScribe** | Oncology | Specialty depth | Low |
| **Freed** | SMB | $99/month disruption | Low |

### Critical Competitive Threat

**Epic "Art for Clinicians"** (announced August 2025) - Epic's native ambient AI using Microsoft Dragon + 300M patient record dataset. This threatens all third-party vendors in Epic shops and may commoditize basic ambient documentation.

| Market position | 33% share, largest installed base |
| Technology | Dragon ASR + Azure OpenAI |
| Epic integration | Deep, long-standing |
| Price | Premium ($500-700/provider/month) |

**Why Limited for Ramsay:**
- US/Epic-centric
- Innovation pace slower than startups

| Single vendor management | Not market leader in US (less relevant) |
| GDPR-native across all regions | Still scaling enterprise |
| All required languages | Smaller than Nuance/Abridge |

**Implementation:**
1. Pilot in France (Nabla HQ region)
2. Expand to Nordics and UK
3. Deploy to Australia with local validation
4. Evaluate Asia requirements

### Option B: Regional Best-of-Breed

**Nabla for EU/UK + Heidi Health for Australia**

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| Local optimization | Two vendor relationships |
| Heidi's AU EHR depth | Integration complexity |
| Best fit per region | Different capabilities |

**Implementation:**
1. Heidi for Australian operations (quick win, local support)
2. Nabla for France, Nordics, UK
3. Evaluate convergence over 2-3 years

### Strategic (6-12 months)

7. **Beyond-the-note roadmap:**
   - Ambient documentation (Year 1)
   - CDI/coding optimization (Year 1-2)
   - CDS integration (Year 2-3)

## Part 7: What You Built at HCA That Applies

Dr. Doulis, your HCA experience is directly relevant:

| HCA Project | Ramsay Application |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Nurse scheduling (100K nurses) | Ramsay workforce optimization |
| Digital handover | Patient safety, care transitions |
| Ambient speech recognition | This vendor selection |
| AI clinical guidance | CDS layer on ambient platform |

**Your edge:** You've implemented at HCA scale. Ramsay is smaller but more complex (multi-country, multi-regulatory). Your pattern recognition on what works at scale is invaluable.
