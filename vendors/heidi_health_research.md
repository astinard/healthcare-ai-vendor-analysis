## 12. Relevance for Ramsay Health (Australian Operations)

### Current Ramsay Health AI Strategy

**Important Context:** Ramsay Health Care has developed its **own AI scribe solution called "Ramsay Scribe"** in partnership with T-Pro (not Heidi Health).

| Aspect | Ramsay Current Approach |
|--------|------------------------|
| AI Scribe | Ramsay Scribe (proprietary with T-Pro) |
| Pilot Site | St Andrew's Ipswich Private Hospital ED |
| Timeline | Pilot started January 2025 |
| Tech Partner | T-Pro (AI clinical documentation) |
| Cloud Partner | Google Cloud (2030 digital strategy) |

### Heidi Health vs. Ramsay's Current Path

| Factor | Heidi Health | Ramsay Scribe |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Maturity | Production at scale (2M+ consults/week) | Pilot phase |
| Specialization | Multi-specialty, proven | Being refined |
| Australian Integration | Best Practice, MedicalDirector | Ramsay systems |
| Cost | Known pricing | Internal development costs |
| Support | 24/7 vendor support | Internal + T-Pro |

### Potential Heidi Value for Ramsay

**If Ramsay were to consider Heidi:**

1. **Scale Advantage:** Heidi's 73M+ consultations provide superior training data and proven performance
2. **Australian Focus:** Local HQ, Australian compliance (APP, ISO 27001), onshore data processing
3. **APAC Expertise:** Already operating in Australia/NZ at scale
4. **EHR Compatibility:** Integrates with Australian systems Ramsay may use
5. **KLAS Validated:** Independent verification of performance
6. **Speed to Deploy:** Production-ready vs. building in-house

**However:**
- Ramsay has already invested in T-Pro partnership and Google Cloud strategy
- Switching costs may outweigh benefits
- Internal solution allows customization for Ramsay's specific workflows
- Ramsay's 10-year digital transformation strategy appears committed

### Recommendation

Heidi Health could be relevant for Ramsay as:
1. **Benchmark competitor** for Ramsay Scribe performance
2. **Potential alternative** if Ramsay Scribe pilot doesn't meet expectations
3. **Technology partner** for specific specialties or regions where Ramsay Scribe isn't deployed
4. **Integration option** for Ramsay's Australian GP/primary care partners
