**Capability:** The Augmedix platform captures structured data from conversations that can support CDI workflows. Specific CDI product deployment at HCA not publicly confirmed.

### Clinical Decision Support (CDS)

**Status:** In development / roadmap item

**HCA Vision (Quote from Dr. Michael Schlosser, SVP Care Transformation & Innovation):**
> "A physician can have an AI agent in their pocket that can assist with documentation. Not just ambient speech, but really understanding the patient context by looking into the EHR that might be relevant to bring it all together as a partner to the clinician."

## 4. Exclusivity

### Confirmed Exclusive Arrangement

**Statement from October 2024 Press Release:**
> "Commure was selected by HCA Healthcare, Inc. as the **exclusive partner** to develop and deploy an ambient AI platform across its network of healthcare professionals."

### Scope of Exclusivity

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Product Category | Ambient AI documentation |
| Geographic Scope | Entire HCA network (US + UK) |
| Care Settings | ED, hospitalist, ambulatory |
| Duration | Not publicly disclosed |
| Financial Terms | Not publicly disclosed |

### Competitive Products

**Key Question:** Can HCA use Microsoft Nuance DAX, Epic Art, or other ambient solutions?

**Analysis:**
- The exclusivity appears specific to "ambient AI platform" co-development
- HCA may retain flexibility for EHR-native solutions (e.g., Epic's ambient features in Epic shops)
- No public statements about complete prohibition on other AI tools
- Practical reality: Enterprise-wide Commure deployment makes alternatives unlikely

### Contract Details

**Publicly Known:**
- "A formal enterprise agreement is being negotiated between the two companies" (October 2024)
- Financial terms undisclosed
- Duration undisclosed

**Assessment:** The exclusivity represents a significant competitive moat for Commure, effectively locking out Microsoft Nuance, Abridge, Nabla, and others from the largest U.S. health system.

### Financial Indicators

**Commure Growth:**
- ARR doubled 3 years consecutively
- $200M funding raised (June 2025) from General Catalyst

| Abridge | Cannot access HCA's 43M annual encounters |
| Nabla | Blocked from major enterprise reference |
| Epic Art | Limited to Epic EHR installations; may coexist |
| Suki | No path to HCA deployment |

### Reference Value

HCA as a reference customer provides Commure with:
- Largest health system deployment proof point
- Scale validation (43M encounters)
- Complex use case coverage (ED, inpatient, ambulatory)
- Enterprise procurement credibility

### Data Advantage

- 43M+ encounters/year feeding model improvement
- Multi-specialty training data
- Complex acute care scenarios (ED-first development)
- Continuous feedback loop from largest provider network
