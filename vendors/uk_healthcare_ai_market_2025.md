**CQC Inspection Focus:**
- Safe deployment in care pathway
- Staff training evidence
- Issue/incident reporting processes
- Technology is safe, effective, caring, responsive, well-led

**Multi-Agency Advice Service (MAAS):**
CQC + NICE + HRA + MHRA = "one-stop shop" for AI/data-driven technology adopters (funded by NHS AI Lab)
