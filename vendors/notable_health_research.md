## 7. Differentiation from Ambient AI Players

### Notable vs. Ambient AI (Nuance, Abridge, Suki)

| Dimension | Notable | Ambient AI Players |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Administrative/operational automation | Clinical documentation |
| **Core Technology** | AI + RPA hybrid | NLP/Speech-to-text + LLMs |
| **Workflow Scope** | Pre-visit, during-visit, post-visit operations | During-visit documentation |
| **User Persona** | Front desk, schedulers, billing, care coordinators | Physicians, nurses |
| **Value Proposition** | Staff productivity, operational efficiency | Clinician burnout, documentation time |
| **Revenue Impact** | Prior auth, billing, A/R | Coding accuracy (indirect) |
| **Patient Touchpoints** | Direct (intake, scheduling, outreach) | Indirect (better notes) |

### Key Differentiators

1. **Operations-First, Not Documentation-First**
   - Notable automates administrative workflows; ambient AI automates note-taking
   - Complementary rather than competitive in many cases

2. **Full Practice Management Platform**
   - KLAS notes: "Notable offers a full practice management platform"
   - Beyond point solution for specific tasks

3. **RPA Execution Layer**
   - Can actually execute workflows in EHR, not just suggest
   - Works with legacy systems that lack modern APIs

4. **Patient-Facing Automation**
   - Direct patient interaction (SMS, web apps)
   - Consumer-grade experience for intake, scheduling

5. **Revenue Cycle Focus**
   - Prior authorization automation
   - Billing and A/R optimization
   - Direct ROI measurement

### Overlap Areas
- Both may address pre-visit chart review
- Both integrate with major EHRs
- Both positioned as workforce productivity tools
