## Clinical Evidence & Outcomes

### Time Savings

| Metric | Improvement | Source |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Door to neurointerventionalist notification | **39.5 minute reduction** | VALIDATE Study |
| Median notification time (AI vs non-AI) | 50 min vs 89.5 min | Multi-center study (14,116 patients) |
| Door-to-groin time | **11 minute reduction** | Multi-center analysis |
| Transfer cases (BEMI) | **33% DTG improvement** | Transfer study |
| ICH interhospital transfer | **50% reduction** (200 min → 101 min) | ICH outcomes study |
