## 5. Technology Challenges

### 5.1 Multi-Country Complexity

**Geographic Footprint:**
- **9 countries** across 4 continents
- **530+ facilities** (hospitals, primary care, mental health)
- **90,000+ employees**

| Region | Facilities | Ownership Structure |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Australia | 74 | Wholly owned |
| UK | 35 | Wholly owned |
| France | 121 (110 hospitals) | Ramsay Santé (majority stake with Crédit Agricole Assurances) |
| Indonesia | 3 | Ramsay Sime Darby JV (50/50 with Sime Darby) |
| Malaysia | 4 | Ramsay Sime Darby JV |

**Operational Model Challenge:**
- Dr. Gandhi's dual role: Direct digital transformation in Australia + guiding digital ambition in other regions globally
- Balance between global strategy and regional autonomy

### 5.2 EHR Diversity

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Multiple EHR vendors | MEDITECH (Australia), MAXIMS (UK), TrakCare (Asia), Others (France) |
| Different maturity levels | UK fully integrated; Australia partially; France consolidating |
| Integration complexity | Limited cross-regional patient data visibility |
| Vendor relationships | Long-term contracts with different vendors |

### 5.3 Data Integration

**Historical Challenge:**
> "Patient and administrative data were held in separate on-premise locations, making analysis and insights extraction a time-intensive and cumbersome process."

**Current Solution Approach:**
- Ramsay Data Hub on Google BigQuery (Australia first)
- Common data definitions model
- Strong data governance for quality and security
- Apigee API Management for healthcare data interoperability
- Anthos Service Mesh for secure data access within/between facilities

### 5.4 Regulatory Differences by Market

| Market | Key Regulatory Considerations |
|--------|------------------------------|
| **Australia** | My Health Record integration; ADHA standards; Privacy Act |
| **UK** | NHS data standards; NHS Digital integration; UK GDPR |
| **France** | HOP'EN program compliance; DMP (Dossier Medical Partagé); SNDS; GDPR |
| **Indonesia** | Indonesian healthcare data regulations; emerging framework |
| **Malaysia** | PDPA; healthcare data localization requirements |

**Ramsay's Approach:**
- Regional accountability frameworks for regulatory compliance
- Dedicated data protection and privacy officers per region
- NIST Cyber Security Framework alignment globally

### 5.5 Technology Debt & Foundation Gaps

**Key Challenge (per Dr. Gandhi):**
> "The challenge in healthcare is that so many foundations are lacking because of under investment in the past. It's not just about maintaining but you're actually still building some foundational things. So it's a balance between constantly innovating and playing catch up on building your foundation so you can innovate more sustainably."

**FY25 Priority:**
- Continuing to address technology debt
- Thoughtful sequencing of investment
- Focus on bringing forward benefits realization
