# Regard AI - Clinical Documentation & CDI Solution Analysis

**Research Date:** November 2025
**Author:** Healthcare AI Vendor Analysis Project

---

## Executive Summary

Regard is an AI-powered clinical insights platform that automates physician documentation and surfaces missed diagnoses at the point of care. Unlike traditional CDI tools that work retrospectively, Regard takes a "proactive documentation" approach - generating near-complete notes before physicians see patients by analyzing all EHR data. The company has raised $84.4M total funding at a $320M valuation and is deployed in 150+ hospitals.

## 8. KLAS Research & Industry Recognition

### KLAS 2024 Emerging Solutions Top 20

Regard was named a winner in the **"Improve Clinician Experience"** category at HLTH 2024.

Other winners in category: Abridge, Redivus Health Code Blue, Suki Assistant, Navina

**Eligibility Requirements:**
- KLAS Spotlight/First Look report between June 2023 - June 2024
- Overall customer score of at least 85/100

### KLAS Spotlight Report (2023)

The solution would solve the problem of data overload and missed diagnoses, ultimately reducing physician burnout and improving patient outcomes. I am impressed by the overwhelmingly positive feedback. One theme throughout the feedback is that Regard needs to add more suggested diagnoses."

### CDI Market Context (2024 KLAS Rankings)

| Vendor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Iodine Software | 92.1 | Best in KLAS CDI 2024 |
| ChartWise | 91.9 | Above market average |
| Market Average | 86.5 | - |
| Regard | 85+ | Different category - point-of-care AI |

**Note:** Regard competes differently than traditional CDI vendors - it's a point-of-care clinical AI tool rather than retrospective CDI software.

---

## 9. Pricing

### Public Pricing Information

**Not publicly disclosed.** Regard uses enterprise-level, negotiated pricing based on:
- Hospital size
- Number of users
- Scope of deployment

### ROI Metrics (In Lieu of Pricing)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Per-Provider Revenue | ~$100,000/year incremental |
| First Department ROI | $3-6M revenue improvement |
| Time Savings | 20% documentation time reduction |
| Time Savings | 2-3 hours/day per clinician |

### Industry Context

AI documentation platforms typically range $100-300/provider/month. Given Regard's enterprise focus and reported ROI, pricing likely falls in the premium tier.

---

## 10. Competitive Positioning

### Market Category

Regard operates at the intersection of:
1. **Clinical Decision Support (CDS)**
2. **Clinical Documentation Improvement (CDI)**
3. **Ambient AI Documentation**

### Key Differentiators

| Factor | Regard Approach |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Timing** | Proactive (before encounter) vs. Reactive (after discharge) |
| **Primary User** | Physician at point of care vs. CDI specialist |
| **Core Value** | Missed diagnosis detection + documentation |
| **AI Role** | "AI Resident" drafting notes |

### Competitive Comparison

| Vendor | Focus | Approach |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Regard** | Diagnosis + Documentation | Proactive, point-of-care |
| **Iodine Software** | CDI | AI-powered retrospective CDI |
| **3M/Solventum** | CDI | Enterprise CDI platform |
| **Nuance/DAX** | Ambient Documentation | Voice-to-note |
| **Abridge** | Ambient Documentation | Voice-to-note + revenue cycle |

### Competitive Strengths

1. Unique "proactive documentation" positioning
2. Diagnosis suggestion engine (not just transcription)
3. Strong KLAS customer satisfaction
4. Health system investor (Cedars-Sinai) validation
5. GPT-4 integration for advanced capabilities

### Competitive Weaknesses/Gaps

1. Smaller scale vs. Nuance/Abridge (150 vs. 400+ hospitals)
2. Lower valuation than ambient AI leaders ($320M vs. $5.3B Abridge)
3. KLAS feedback: "needs to add more suggested diagnoses"
4. Limited public pricing transparency
5. Inpatient-focused (outpatient expansion still in roadmap)

---

## 11. Nuance Partnership Status

### Finding: No Partnership Identified

Research did not identify a specific Regard-Nuance partnership. The two companies appear to be **competitors** in the clinical documentation AI space rather than partners.

**Nuance/Microsoft** has its own clinical documentation suite (DAX Copilot) and would be a direct competitor to Regard's capabilities.

## 12. 2025-2026 Roadmap

### Confirmed 2025 Developments

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Proactive Documentation Platform | Launched July 2025 |
| All-Specialty Expansion | Launched July 2025 |
| AI Agent "Max" Enhancements | Active |

### Stated Roadmap Priorities

1. **Outpatient Expansion**: Move beyond inpatient facilities
2. **LLM Research**: Fundamental R&D in large language models
3. **Multi-Specialty Coverage**: Already shipping (all hospital service lines)
4. **Platform Expansion**: From hospitalists to entire hospital

### Expected Focus Areas (Based on Funding Use)

- Deeper EHR integrations
- Additional specialty modules
- Ambulatory/outpatient documentation
- Enhanced AI agent capabilities
