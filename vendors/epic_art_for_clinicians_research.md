## 8. Impact on Third-Party Vendors

### Market Dynamics Shift

Epic's entry is described as a **"watershed moment"** by health system CIOs.

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Market Position | 42% of U.S. hospitals, 55% of beds on Epic |
| Leverage | Massive distribution advantage |
| Bundling Pressure | Third-party vendors face price compression |
| Integration Reality | Native solution eliminates integration friction |

### Vendor-Specific Impact

| Vendor | Position | Response |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Nuance/Microsoft** | Best positioned | Powers Epic's Dragon backend; can serve Epic and non-Epic customers |
| **Abridge** | Strong but pressured | Maintains Epic "First Pal" status; differentiating on revenue cycle intelligence |
| **Ambience** | $243M Series C | Moving beyond ambient to coding, revenue cycle |
| **Suki** | Platform pivot | Focusing on MEDITECH, building infrastructure layer |
| **DeepScribe** | Specialty focus | Doubling down on oncology specialization |

### Startup Funding Activity (2025)

Despite Epic's entry, ambient AI continues attracting capital:

| Vendor | Round | Amount | Total Raised |
|--------|-------|--------|--------------|
| Abridge | Series E | $300M | ~$800M |
| Ambience | Series C | $243M | ~$345M |
| Suki | To date | - | ~$168M |
| Nabla | Series C | $70M | ~$120M |

### Expected Market Structure

- **Short-term**: Hybrid market with both native EHR and third-party solutions
- **Long-term**: Consolidation toward native EHR solutions with third-party specialists surviving in:
  - Specialty-specific (oncology, ED)
  - Revenue cycle / coding
  - Multi-EHR environments (non-Epic shops)

---

## 9. Competitive Implications

### Epic's Strategic Position

| Strength | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Distribution | 42% hospitals, 55% beds |
| Data Moat | 300M+ patients in Cosmos |
| Integration | Zero friction for existing customers |
| Trust | 46-year track record |
| Resources | 160-200 AI projects in development |

### How Third-Party Vendors Can Compete

1. **Specialty Depth**: Oncology, ED, procedural specialties
2. **Revenue Cycle Integration**: Coding, prior auth, denial management
3. **Multi-EHR**: Cerner/Oracle, MEDITECH, athenahealth shops
4. **Speed to Market**: Beat Epic's limited 2026 rollout
5. **Proven Outcomes**: Demonstrate superior ROI vs. native option

### Risk Factors for Startups

- Bundled pricing pressure
- "Good enough" native solution for many use cases
- Customer tendency to prefer single-vendor stack
- Epic's ability to iterate rapidly once launched

## 10. CEO Judy Faulkner Quotes (UGM 2025)

> "We've got somewhere between 160 and 200 AI projects going. Some of them are completed and some are in process. And some of it will be permeating every area of our software."

> "We've been told that 10% to 20% of diagnoses are wrong... getting the diagnosis correct by looking at Cosmos and alerting the doctor may be good thing."
