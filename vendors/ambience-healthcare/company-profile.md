## 3. Technology

### LLM Approach

**Architecture**:
- Multi-model architecture calling different language models tuned for specific medical tasks
- Each note section generated by specialized, fine-tuned models
- **OpenAI partnership** - Uses OpenAI's reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) technology
- Custom models trained specifically for healthcare domains

**Medical Coding AI** (Announced May 2025):
- New model outperforms physicians by **27%** on medical coding tasks
- Trained using OpenAI's reinforcement fine-tuning technology
- Designed for revenue integrity and coding accuracy

**Founding Innovation**: The Ambience founders were among the first to put **transformer architecture** into production for clinical use. Notably, investor Jeff Dean (Google Chief Scientist) led the research group at Google Brain that invented the transformer architecture.

### ASR Technology

**Speech Recognition**:
- Fine-tuned models trained specifically for medical speech recognition
- Leverages OpenAI's **Whisper** as a foundational component
- Optimized for clinical vocabulary and multi-specialty terminology
- Multi-language support across dozens of languages

**Processing Pipeline**:
1. Audio capture via mobile app (with patient consent)
2. Medical speech recognition transcription
3. Multi-model LLM processing for different note sections
4. Structured output generation with billing codes
5. Direct EHR integration

### Key Technical Differentiators

1. **Speed**: Notes generated "within seconds" (fastest in competitive evaluations)
2. **Specialty depth**: Architecture designed to handle 200+ specialty-specific requirements
3. **Accuracy**: Achieved selection over competitors in Cleveland Clinic head-to-head testing
4. **Utilization**: Claims 70-80% provider utilization vs 30-40% for competitors
5. **Customization**: Learns individual provider documentation style

### Architecture Philosophy

> "What Cleveland Clinic found is that ambient listening isn't one product—it's like 50 different products. You can't take a primary care solution and force it into an emergency department or an oncology unit." — Nikhil Buduma, CEO

The architecture is designed to "bake in the rich heterogeneity across specialties into the fundamental architecture, product design, and the actual models being fine-tuned."
