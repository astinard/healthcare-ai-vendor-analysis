## 4. Regulatory & Compliance

### Australian Privacy Principles (APP)

|---------------|--------|
| **APP Compliance** | ✅ Certified ("first badge of honour") |
| **NZ IPPs** | ✅ Compliant |
| **ISO 27001** | ✅ Certified |
| **SOC 2 Type II** | ✅ Certified |

**Data Sovereignty:**
- All Australian data **locally hosted within Australia**
- No permanent audio storage - *"disappears after the job's done"*
- Onshore processing guaranteed

### TGA Regulatory Status

The TGA classifies AI medical scribes under Clinical Decision Support Software (CDSS), which may qualify for exemption conditional on TGA notification. Heidi has not publicly disclosed specific TGA registration status, but their compliance posture suggests adherence to applicable requirements.

**Key Consideration:** AI/ML-powered software meeting the "medical device" definition under the TG Act must comply with TGA requirements. Heidi's documentation assistance focus (vs. clinical decision-making) may place it in the exempt CDSS category.

### Global Compliance Framework

| Jurisdiction | Standard | Status |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| Australia | APP | ✅ |
| New Zealand | NZ IPPs | ✅ |
| United States | HIPAA | ✅ |
| European Union | GDPR | ✅ |
| United Kingdom | NHS regulations | ✅ |
| Canada | PIPEDA | ✅ |
