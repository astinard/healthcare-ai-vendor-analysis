## 2. HCA Healthcare Innovations He Led

### A. Timpani Scheduling & Staffing Platform

**The Challenge:** HCA Healthcare employs ~36,000 nurses across 188 hospitals, with 99,000+ nurses across the entire network.

**The Solution:** Timpani - a clinical labor management platform co-developed with Palantir.

**Key Features:**
- Human-informed, data-driven automated scheduling
- Optimizes team composition and experience mix per shift
- Mobile companion app (Timpani Mobile) with 26,000+ downloads
- Integrates staff preferences, skills, abilities, and proficiency

**Scale & Results:**
- Launched 2023 across 9 pilot sites
- ~7,000 colleagues using daily (as of mid-2024)
- Deployed to ~50 facilities; targeting 90+ additional by end of 2025
- Saved nursing leaders "hundreds of hours" on scheduling
- Designed to address workforce shortages and improve retention

### B. Digital Handover / Nurse Handoff Tool

**Partnership:** HCA Healthcare + Google Cloud (announced August 2023)

**Technology:** AI-powered app using Google's Med-PaLM 2 large language model

**Purpose:**
- Streamline shift handoff communications between nurses
- Capture critical clinical details: medication changes, lab results, vital signs, patient concerns
- Reduce administrative burden during shift transitions

**Status:** Beta testing at UCF Lake Nona Hospital; planned rollout to all 99,000 nurses

### C. Ambient Speech Recognition & Documentation

**Partnership Evolution:**
1. **2023:** Augmedix partnership announced; HCA invested ~$12M in Augmedix
2. **2024:** Commure acquired Augmedix; HCA selected Commure as exclusive ambient AI partner

**Pilot Program:**
- 75 emergency department physicians across 4 HCA hospitals
- Augmedix app on mobile/hands-free devices
- Records physician-patient encounters
- Extracts non-clinical conversation and ambient noise
- Produces medical notes for physician review

**Key Technical Insights:**
- Automatic speech recognition (ASR) can identify voice differences
- Challenge: Ambient noise in ED, soft-spoken patients
- Guardrails: Low-confidence words highlighted for physician review
- Potential: Clinical guidance prompts (protocols, reminders)

**Scale Commitment:** October 2024 - Commure partnership announced as "largest AI deployment in healthcare worldwide" for HCA's network.

### D. AI-Driven Clinical Guidance

**Philosophy:** "AI becomes not just an enabler, but I believe it is going to accelerate our ability — and likely even create an ability we wouldn't otherwise have — to advance our safety model."

**Applications:**
- Protocol reminders embedded in ambient AI workflow
- Patient safety integration
- Augmentation approach: "How do we enhance human decision making, not replace it?"

## 4. Connections to Alex Stinard, MD

### Organizational Overlap at HCA Healthcare

Both Dr. Doulis and Dr. Alex Stinard worked within HCA Healthcare's innovation ecosystem:

| Person | HCA Role | Team | Focus Area |
|--------|----------|------|------------|
| **John Doulis** | VP & Distinguished Architect | Digital Transformation & Innovation (DT&I) | Strategy, architecture, partnerships |
| **Alex Stinard** | ED Medical Director, UCF Lake Nona Hospital | Care Transformation & Innovation (CT&I) | Clinical testing, innovation hub |

### CT&I → DT&I Evolution

- **CT&I (Care Transformation and Innovation):** Founded 2021
- **DT&I (Digital Transformation and Innovation):** Evolved from CT&I in 2024
- Both teams focused on clinician-led technology integration

### Innovation Hub Connection

Dr. Stinard was "entrenched at UCF Lake Nona Hospital, CT&I's first Innovation Hub" - a living laboratory for:
- Testing and producing innovative solutions
- Improving care delivery and experience
- Direct partnership with CT&I/DT&I teams

### Augmedix/Commure Work Overlap

**Shared Initiative - Ambient AI Pilot:**

| Aspect | John Doulis | Alex Stinard |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Role** | Partnership architect & strategy lead | Clinical testing & frontline implementation |
| **Involvement** | Announced HCA-Augmedix partnership | Used Augmedix app daily in patient encounters |
| **Focus** | Enterprise-wide deployment planning | Identified opportunities for improvement |

**Alex Stinard's Direct Involvement:**
- Used Augmedix app on mobile device during patient conversations
- One of 75 ED physicians in pilot program
- Provided feedback to CT&I and Augmedix teams
- Helped design and implement large language models and generative AI

### Stinard's Career Progression (Post-HCA)

| Period | Organization | Role |
|--------|--------------|------|
| HCA | Augmedix | AI Advisory Council Member |
| 2024 | Augmedix | Chief Clinical AI Officer (appointed May 2024) |
| Current | Commure | Chief Clinical AI Officer |

The Commure acquisition of Augmedix means Dr. Stinard now leads clinical AI at the vendor that HCA selected as its exclusive ambient AI partner.

## 5. Implications for Ramsay AI Strategy

### A. Anticipated AI Approach

Based on Dr. Doulis's HCA playbook:

**1. Partnership-First Model**
- Prefers strategic partnerships over pure build
- Examples: Palantir (scheduling), Google Cloud (handoff), Augmedix/Commure (ambient AI)
- Likely to leverage vendor expertise while retaining strategic control

**2. Clinically-Led Integration**
- "Clinically-led integration of technology into care" was DT&I's mantra
- Physician executive → will demand clinical validation
- Solutions must demonstrate measurable clinician benefit

**3. Augmentation Philosophy**
- "How do we enhance human decision making, not replace it?"
- AI as a safety accelerator, not replacement
- Focus on reducing administrative burden

**4. Platform Thinking**
- "Distinguished Architect" title indicates platform/infrastructure focus
- Multi-specialty, EHR-agnostic approach (from Commure partnership)
- Likely to build foundational data/AI platform at Ramsay

### B. HCA Learnings Applicable to Ramsay

| HCA Learning | Ramsay Application |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Nurse scheduling optimization saves hundreds of hours | Ramsay's 70+ AU hospitals have similar staffing challenges |
| Ambient AI reduces documentation by 80% | Ramsay Scribe pilot (T-Pro) may be evaluated against Commure |
| ED ambient noise requires ASR guardrails | Technical requirements for Ramsay implementations |
| Clinician feedback loop essential | Innovation hub model could be replicated in Australia |
| Google Cloud LLMs effective for handoff | Potential cloud partnership for Ramsay |

### C. Vendor Relationships from HCA

**Likely to Explore:**
| Vendor | HCA Relationship | Ramsay Relevance |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Commure/Augmedix** | Exclusive ambient AI partner; HCA investor | High - proven enterprise deployment |
| **Google Cloud** | Handoff tool, Med-PaLM 2 | High - clinical AI capabilities |
| **Palantir** | Timpani scheduling platform | Medium - data platform expertise |
| **Epic (Expanse)** | EHR platform rollout | Low - Ramsay uses different EHRs |

**Existing Ramsay Relationships:**
- **T-Pro:** Ramsay Scribe (ambient documentation pilot)
- May evaluate T-Pro against Commure/Augmedix based on HCA experience

### D. Build vs. Buy Philosophy

Based on observable patterns:

| Capability | HCA Approach | Expected Ramsay Approach |
|------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| **Core Clinical AI** | Partner (Augmedix/Commure) | Partner - leverage proven solutions |
| **Scheduling Platform** | Co-develop (Palantir) | Likely partner with customization |
| **Data Infrastructure** | Internal platform team | Build internal capabilities |
| **Clinical Validation** | Internal clinician teams | Build internal expertise |
| **Integration Layer** | Internal engineering | Build for local EHR landscape |

**Philosophy Summary:**
Strategic partnerships for specialized AI capabilities + internal platform/integration teams for enterprise control. Not "build everything" nor "buy everything" - a **co-development model** with key vendors.
