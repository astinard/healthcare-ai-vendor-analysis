# MEDITECH Native AI & Ambient Documentation Capabilities

*Research Date: November 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

MEDITECH is pursuing an **AI partner ecosystem strategy** rather than building proprietary ambient AI, positioning itself as a platform that integrates with multiple best-of-breed AI vendors. The company has deep partnerships with Google Cloud (search/summarization), Suki (first ambient documentation API integration), Nuance/Microsoft (DAX Copilot), and Commure (mobile ambient AI). MEDITECH's AI philosophy emphasizes human-in-the-loop design, clinician control, and vendor-agnostic flexibility.
