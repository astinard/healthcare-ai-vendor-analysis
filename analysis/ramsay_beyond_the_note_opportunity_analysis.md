## 1. CODING OPPORTUNITY BY REGION

### 1.1 Australia (AR-DRG, MBS)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Coding System** | AR-DRG (Australian Refined Diagnosis Related Groups) + ICD-10-AM + ACHI |
| **Funding Model** | Activity-based funding (ABF) for public; case-mix for private insurance |
| **Complexity** | High - Australian modifications to ICD-10 create unique requirements |
| **Current State** | Largely manual coding with retrospective review |
| **AI Readiness** | Medium - Limited vendor support for ICD-10-AM |

**Opportunity Assessment:**
- **Revenue at risk:** 2-5% of case revenue from coding accuracy gaps
- **Coder productivity:** 15-25% improvement potential with AI-assisted coding
- **MBS (Medicare Benefits Schedule):** Item number selection for procedures creates optimization opportunity
- **Private insurance:** Accurate coding directly impacts reimbursement from Medibank, Bupa, HCF

**Estimated Annual Impact:** $20-40M across Ramsay Australia operations

**Challenge:** Few US vendors support ICD-10-AM natively. Requires either:
- Vendor willing to build AU-specific capability
- Local vendor (Heidi Health) expanding into coding
- Localization investment with major vendor

### 1.2 UK (HRG, NHS Tariff)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Coding System** | HRG (Healthcare Resource Groups) + ICD-10 UK |
| **Funding Model** | NHS tariff for NHS-funded work; fee-for-service private |
| **Complexity** | Medium-High - NHS-specific requirements |
| **Current State** | Mixed automation; some NHS trusts using AI |
| **AI Readiness** | Medium - GDPR compliance required |

**Opportunity Assessment:**
- **NHS work:** Tariff optimization through accurate HRG assignment
- **Private pay:** Direct revenue impact from accurate coding
- **Dual revenue streams:** Many patients have both NHS and private coverage
- **Consultant-led model:** Ramsay UK relies on visiting consultants, complicating documentation capture

**Estimated Annual Impact:** $10-20M across Ramsay UK operations

**Challenge:** UK market smaller, regulatory environment (MHRA, UK GDPR) adds complexity. Nuance has strongest UK presence.

### 1.3 France (T2A, GHS)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Coding System** | GHS (Groupes Homogènes de Séjours) + T2A (tarification à l'activité) |
| **Funding Model** | Activity-based (T2A) for most hospital revenue |
| **Complexity** | High - French-specific coding requirements |
| **Current State** | Centralized coding departments, some automation |
| **AI Readiness** | Medium - GDPR + French health data laws |

**Opportunity Assessment:**
- **Ramsay Santé scale:** Largest private hospital operator in France
- **T2A optimization:** Direct revenue impact from GHS assignment accuracy
- **Language requirement:** French-language documentation mandatory
- **Sécurité sociale:** Complex billing to social security system
- **Mutuelle billing:** Secondary insurance adds complexity

**Estimated Annual Impact:** $25-45M across Ramsay Santé operations (largest single-country opportunity)

**Challenge:** French language + French coding = very limited vendor options. Nabla (Paris HQ) is best positioned.

### 1.4 Nordics (Sweden, Norway, Denmark)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Coding System** | NordDRG variants (country-specific) |
| **Funding Model** | Mix of public funding, activity-based elements |
| **Complexity** | Medium - Smaller scale, standardized systems |
| **Current State** | High digital maturity, some AI adoption |
| **AI Readiness** | High - Advanced healthcare IT infrastructure |

**Opportunity Assessment:**

## 2. CDI OPPORTUNITY

### 2.1 DRG Optimization Potential

Clinical Documentation Integrity (CDI) improves the accuracy and completeness of clinical documentation to ensure DRG assignment reflects true patient acuity.

**Global CDI Opportunity for Ramsay:**

| Factor | Current State | AI-Enabled Target | Gap |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|-----|
| **CMI (Case Mix Index)** | Likely underweight by 2-5% | Accurate capture | Revenue recapture |
| **CC/MCC Capture** | Underdocumented | Real-time prompts | Higher DRG weights |
| **Query Response Time** | Days (retrospective) | Real-time (concurrent) | Faster billing |
| **CDI FTE Efficiency** | 1 CDI per 15-20 providers | 1 CDI per 30-50 providers | Labor savings |

### 2.2 Severity Capture Gaps

**Common Under-Documented Conditions:**
- Malnutrition (major impact on DRG weight)
- Acute kidney injury staging
- Sepsis severity
- Respiratory failure specificity
- Diabetes with complications
- Obesity as comorbidity

**Surgical Hospital Relevance:**
Ramsay's surgical focus means high-acuity cases where severity documentation matters most. A single malnutrition capture in a surgical patient can increase reimbursement by $2,000-5,000 depending on the DRG system.

### 2.3 CMI Improvement Opportunity

| Region | Estimated CMI Gap | Revenue Impact |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Australia** | 2-4% | $15-30M |
| **France** | 3-5% | $20-35M |
| **UK** | 1-3% | $5-15M |
| **Nordics** | 1-2% | $2-5M |

**Total CDI Opportunity: $42-85M annually**

### 2.4 Regional CDI Applicability

| Region | CDI Relevance | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Australia** | **High** | AR-DRG very sensitive to severity documentation |
| **France** | **High** | T2A/GHS directly tied to documentation quality |
| **UK** | **Medium** | HRG optimization valuable; NHS caps limit upside |
| **Nordics** | **Medium** | Quality-focused systems; some CDI benefit |
| **US** | *N/A* | Ramsay has no US operations |
